        <p>
            To anchor this project, we can make the following assumption using domain knowledge:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Property Size:</strong> Larger properties will likely command higher sale prices.</li>
            <li><strong>Neighborhood:</strong> Properties located in premium neighborhoods will be priced higher due to
                demand and amenities.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Overall Quality:</strong> Building material quality and property condition will play a
                significant role in determining the price.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Year Built:</strong> Newly constructed or recently renovated properties will tend to have higher
                prices compared to older ones.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Garage Size:</strong> Larger garages may increase a property's value due to added utility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This can be translated into the following Null Hypotheses:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>H₀ = Property size is not a significant predictor of price.</li>
            <li>H₀ = Neighborhood is not a significant predictor of price.</li>
            <li>H₀ = Overall quality is not a significant predictor of price</li>
            <li>H₀ = Age of property is not a significant predictor of price.</li>
            <li>H₀ = Garage capacity is not a significant predictor of price</li>

        <!-- Step 1: Calculate Growth Rate -->
        <h5>1. Calculating Growth Rate Using Median Sale Price (2006–2024)</h5>
        <p>
        <p>
            The growth rate of property values was calculated using the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) formula:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>
                    CAGR = (Median Sale Price (2024) / Median Sale Price (2006))^(1 / Years) - 1

        <!-- Step 2: Compounding Sale Price -->
        <h5>2. Compounding Sale Price Using Growth Rate</h5>
        <p>
            Using the calculated growth rate, the future value of sale prices was forecasted using the formula:
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Imputing Missing Values:</strong>
                Missing values were treated as follows, based on validation using other variables in the dataset:
                <ul>
                    <li>Numerical features (e.g., <em>GarageArea</em>, <em>BsmtFinSF1</em>) were filled with
                        <strong>0</strong> when the absence of a feature (e.g., no garage or no basement) was confirmed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Categorical features (e.g., <em>PoolQC</em>, <em>MiscFeature</em>) were filled with
                        <strong>None</strong> when the missing values represented the absence of that feature (e.g., no
                        pool or no shed).
                    </li>
                    <li>For features dependent on neighborhoods (e.g., <em>LotFrontage</em>), missing values were
                        imputed with the median value of the neighborhood to account for local variation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Feature Engineering:</strong>
                Three variables were engineered:
                <ul>
                    <li>TotalSQFT: Sum of <em>GrLivArea</em> and <em>TotalBsmtSF</em>.</li>
                    <li>Decade Built: Calculated as the floor division of <em>Year Built</em> by 10, multiplied by 10
                    </li>
                    <li>TotalBaths: Sum of full and half bathrooms, including basement bathrooms:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>FullBath + (0.5 × HalfBath) + BsmtFullBath + (0.5 × BsmtHalfBath)</li>

        <!-- Step 4: Encoding Features -->
        <h5>4. Encoding Features</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Nominal Features:</strong> One-hot encoding was applied using <em>pd.get_dummies</em> to handle
                variables such as <em>Neighborhood</em> and <em>Exterior1st</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ordinal Features:</strong> Custom mappings were applied to features like <em>ExterQual</em> and

            <h4 class='mb-3'>Understanding the Dataset</h4>
            <p>
                To gain a contextual understanding of the dataset and sale price, let's first compare the summary
                statistics
                of the original sale price and the adjusted sale price.
            </p>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/originalSalePriceSummaryStats.png') }}"
                 alt="Descriptive Statistics for Sale Price" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
            <br>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/AdjustedSalePriceSummaryStats.png') }}"
                 alt="Descriptive Statistics for Sale Price" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
            <br>
            <p>
                Observing these two charts, we can identify significant outliers on both end of the spectrum.
                However, the typical price of properties often range between 130-200k for the orignal sale price and
                200-300k for the adjusted sale price.
            </p>
            <p>Just gleaning from this information we can make an assumption that Ames properties would fall in the
                category of
                affordable housing. Just as a note, moving forward any sale price will be referring to the adjusted sale
                price. </p>
            <p>Let's also visualize the distribution of the sale price to see if we can glean any additional
                insights:</p>
        </div>

        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/adjustedSalePriceDistribution.png') }}"
             alt="Distribution of Sale Price" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
        <br>
        <p>Based on the distribution curve, we can observe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A majority of the properties have sale prices concentrated in the lower to mid-price range.</li>
            <li>A right skew; indicating outliers of high-value properties that exceed the typical price range.</li>
            <li>The mode appears to be around the $200,000 - $250,000 region; suggesting this is the most common range
                for
                property sale prices.
            </li>
            <li>An outlier property reached a sale value of $1.2 million; although such cases are scarce.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Scatter Plot Visualization -->

        <p>Now let's visualize the relationship between TotalSQFT and Sale Price:</p>

        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/totalSqftSalePrice.png') }}"
             alt="Scatter Plot of Total SQFT vs Sale Price" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
        <br>
        <p>Based on the scatter plot above, we can observe:
        <ul>
            <li>A positive correlation; there is a clear positive trend where an increase in total square footage
                generally correlates with a high sale price. Though, it is important to note that there is some
                variability.
            </li>
            <li>The data points are densely clustered around smaller property sizes (1,000–3,000 SQFT) and lower sale
                prices
                ($100,000–$400,000). This reflects the most common property size and price range in the dataset.
            </li>
            <li>
                For properties below 3,000 SQFT, the relationship between size and price is tighter and more consistent,
                while larger
                properties show greater variability in sale prices, likely influenced by other variables.
            </li>
            <li>Although this chart alone is not sufficient evidence, it does suggest rejecting the null hypothesis that
                property size does not affect sale price.
            </li>
            <li>We will validate its significance later when we conduct our regression analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Next, let's take a look at the relationship between neighborhoods and sale price:</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/neighborhoodSalePrice.png') }}"
             alt="Box Plot of Neighborhood and Sale Price" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
        <br>
        <p>Based on the boxplot above, we can observe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Variation in sale price varies across different neighborhoods.</li>
            <li>Neighborhoods like StoneBr (Stone Brook), NridgHt (Northridge Heights), and NoRidge (Northridge) have
                higher median sale prices, indicating they
                are luxury or high-value areas.
            </li>
            <li>Whereas Neighborhoods like MeadowV (Meadow Village), BrDale (Briardale), and Edwards have lower median
                sale
                prices,
                suggesting affordability.
            </li>
            <li>Wide IQRs (e.g., NridgHt, NoRidge) suggest high variability in sale prices, likely due to diverse
                property
                features.
            </li>
            <li>Narrow IQRs (e.g., BrDale, MeadowV) indicate uniform property values within those neighborhoods.</li>
            <li>The box plot suggests rejecting the null hypothesis (H₀), as neighborhood significantly impacts sale
                price.
            </li>
            <li>To verify this suggestion, a one-way ANOVA test was conducted using Neighborhood as the categorical
                independent variable and Sale Price as the dependent variable.
            </li>
            <li>The resulting p-value = 0.0 which validates the neighborhood's statistical significance; hence the
                neighborhood's H₀ can be rejected.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Moving on, let's visualize the relationship between overall quality and sale price:</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/qualitySalePrice.png') }}"
             alt="Box Plot of Neighborhood and Sale Price" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
        <br>
        <p>Based on the boxplot above, we can observe:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A strong positive relationship between quality and sale price</li>
            <li>Properties with Overall Quality = 2 have very low sale prices.</li>
            <li>Properties with Overall Quality = 10 have significantly higher median sale prices.</li>
            <li>As the overall quality improves, the spread (range) of sale prices also increases; likely influenced by
                other variables.
            </li>
            <li>There are notable outliers in several quality levels (e.g., 5, 7, 8, and 10), indicating that some
                properties sell for much higher or lower prices than expected within those categories; potentially
                indicating that they might belong to different market segments or is inclusive of special features.
            </li>
            <li>Overall, a one-way ANOVA test confirms Overall Quality's statistical significance with a p-value = 0.0,
                therefore, reject H₀.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Moving on to Year Built:</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/yearBuiltSalePrice.png') }}"
             alt="Box Plot of Neighborhood and Sale Price" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
        <br>
        <p>Based on the box plot above, we can observe: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sale prices generally increase for properties built in more recent decades, with a noticeable upward
                trend
                starting from 1980s onwards.
            </li>
            <li>Median sale prices for properties built in the 2000s are significantly higher compared to earlier
                decades;
                suggesting a preference for recently built properties.
            </li>
            <li>Older properties (pre-1940) have a narrower range of sale prices, indicating more uniform pricing;
                with exclusion of 1880, potentially due to recent renovation.
            </li>
            <li>Variances in outliers begins to a become more pronounced from 1980s onwards as evidenced
                by the taller boxplots and longer whiskers.
            </li>
            <li>An ANOVA test confirms our suspicion that Decade Built is a statistically significant predictor of
                price.
                Reject H₀.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lastly, lets visualize the relationship between garage capacity and sale price:</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/garageCars.png') }}"
             alt="garageCars" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
        <br>
        <p>
            Based on the scatter plot above we can observe:
        <ul>
            <li>There is a positive correlation whereby a higher garage capacity is associated with higher-value
                properties.
            </li>
            <li>Properties with no garage are clustered at the lower end of sale prices, indicating that garage space
                is a salient feature when determining home value
            </li>
            <li>Most homes have a garage space for between 1-3 cars. With 2 car garages being the most common.
                However, high-value properties are more associated with 3 car garages
            </li>
            <li>Interestingly, the price of properties with 4 or 5 car garages begins to slope down, although
                there are not enough data points in these two categories to infer meaningful insights.
            </li>

        <h4>Data Modeling</h4>
        <p>The <strong>goal</strong> of this section is to go beyond simple visualizations and statistical tests
            to uncover the
            nuanced relationships between independent variables and the dependent variable (sale price). This
            dataset includes many correlated variables (e.g., Garage Cond, Garage Area, Garage Cars, Garage Qual),
            which can introduce multicollinearity in regression models. So first task on the agenda is to handle
            multi-collinearity.</p>

        <p>Based on the remaining numerical variables, only the following variables are experiencing
            multi-collinearity (corr > .7). As a solution, we can drop the <strong>garage area</strong> variable from
            our
            variable list. </p>
        <p>Now that we've handled multi-collinearity, let's start off with a basic regression model to establish a
            baseline:</p>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/vanilla_regression_result.jpg') }}"
             alt="Regression Result" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
        <br>
        <section>
            <p><strong>Dependent Variable:</strong> The model is designed to predict <em>AdjustedSalePrice</em></p>

            <p><strong>R-squared (0.930):</strong> This metric quantifies the proportion of variability in <em>AdjustedSalePrice</em>
                explained by the predictors in the model. A value of 93% indicates the model provides an excellent fit
                to the data. However, this high value warrants scrutiny for potential overfitting, especially with a
                large number of predictors.</p>

            <p><strong>Adjusted R-squared (0.924):</strong> This adjusted metric accounts for the inclusion of 191
                predictors, penalizing the addition of variables that do not significantly improve the model's
                explanatory power. The minimal difference between
                <em>R²</em> and Adjusted <em>R²</em> suggests that most predictors contribute meaningful information,
                though some may still be redundant or insignificant.</p>

            <p><strong>F-statistic</strong> (148.0) and <strong>Prob</strong> (F-statistic = 0.00):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The F-statistic tests the joint null hypothesis that all regression coefficients (excluding the
                    intercept) are zero.
                </li>
                <li>A high value of 148 and a p-value of 0.00 strongly reject this null hypothesis, indicating that at
                    least one predictor significantly explains variation in <em>AdjustedSalePrice</em>.
                </li>
                <li>The magnitude of the F-statistic reflects the collective explanatory strength of the model.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Number of Observations (2326):</strong> The sample size provides robust statistical power,
                reducing the likelihood of Type II errors. However, with 191 predictors, the ratio of predictors to
                observations (approximately 1:12) should be monitored to avoid overparameterization.</p>

            <p><strong>Degrees of Freedom (Df</strong>):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Df Residuals (2134): Indicates the number of independent observations remaining after estimating 191
                    model parameters. A large residual degree of freedom ensures stable parameter estimates.
                </li>
                <li>Df Model (191): Represents the number of predictors, reflecting the model's complexity. With this
                    many predictors, multicollinearity and overfitting risks must be addressed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The OLS regression model provides a strong explanation of the variability in AdjustedSalePrice, with an
                R^2 of 93% and an adjusted R^2
                of 92.4%, indicating excellent predictive power while accounting for the large number of predictors. The
                model is statistically significant overall, as evidenced by an F-statistic of 148 and a corresponding
                p-value of 0.00, which strongly rejects the null hypothesis that all predictors have no effect on
                AdjustedSalePrice. However, the complexity of the model, with 191 predictors and a
                predictor-to-observation ratio of approximately 1:12, warrants careful evaluation of multi-collinearity
                and overfitting.</p>
            <p>To refine this model, let's build the model again, this time removing insignificant (variables with
                p-value < .05)</p>
            <p>Based on the result of the initial regression model, the following variables has a p-value of < 0.05
                (and will therefore, be dropped):</p>

            <p>After dropping the insignificant variables and re-running model again, this is the result:</p>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/refined_vanilla_regression.jpg') }}"
                 alt="Refined Regression Result" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
            <br>
            <p>After removing the redundant variables, the predictive power of the model remains largely unaffected, as
                evidenced by the negligible difference between the R^2 and Adjusted R^2
                . This demonstrates that the excluded variables contributed little to explaining the variance in the
                dependent variable, reaffirming the validity of the remaining predictors. Additionally, the reduction in
                the number of parameters from 191 to 150 has significantly simplified the model, improving its
                interpretability and reducing the risk of overfitting. By focusing only on the most meaningful
                variables, the model strikes a balance between simplicity and statistical robustness, ensuring it
                remains both computationally efficient and generalizable to new data. </p>
            <p>While reducing the model parameters to 150 is a step in the right direction, it is still relatively high
                for practical use, particularly if the goal is to serialize the model for deployment in real-world
                applications, such as predicting property prices using Zillow data. A simpler, more parsimonious model
                would streamline predictions and ensure ease of implementation in systems with limited computational
                resources. However, this simplification often comes with a trade-off—sacrificing some predictive power
                for practicality. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate priorities: whether to prioritize a complex yet
                highly accurate model or a more practical, lightweight model that balances efficiency and usability.</p>
            <p>My next step in simplifying the model involves removing all categorical variables from the regression.
                Based on my observations, the majority of categorical variables are statistically insignificant, with
                only a few showing meaningful relationships with the dependent variable. Retaining these variables adds
                unnecessary complexity without substantially improving the model's predictive power. By excluding them,
                the model can focus solely on the numerical predictors that are more relevant and impactful, further
                simplifying its structure while maintaining its validity for practical applications. This approach will
                also streamline model serialization and deployment for real-world use cases, such as property price
                prediction.</p>
            <p>After dropping all categorical variables, and insignificant numerical variables this is
                the result of the regression: </p>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/refined_numerical_regression.jpg') }}"
                 alt="Refined Numerical Regression Result" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
            <br>
            <p>We successfully reduced number of predictors from 191 to just 17,
                significantly simplifying its structure. The R^2
                value is now 87.1%, with an Adjusted R^2
                of 87%, indicating a slight reduction in predictive power. However, considering the drastic reduction in
                complexity, this sacrifice is relatively minor and well worth the improved practicality. This
                streamlined model is far more suitable for real-world applications, such as predicting property prices.
                The next step is to assess whether these remaining predictors correspond to information readily
                available for properties listed on Zillow, ensuring the model's feasibility for deployment.</p>

                Based on the mapping above, it appears that only Lot Frontage and Wood Deck SF should be considered for
                removal, as it
                lacks a clear assumption or direct mapping from available property data (e.g., Zillow). While it can be
                imputed with a median value to retain consistency in the dataset, doing so might introduce noise or
                reduce
                model interpretability. Instead, excluding Lot Frontage and Wood Deck SF simplifies the model further
                while
                only sacrificing a small amount of predictive power (reduced R^2 by .004), ensuring that the model
                remains
                practical and easy to deploy with real-world property data.
            </p>
            <p>Now that we've decided on the significant predictors of properties, let's experiment with various
                predictive models, to see which yields the highest R^2 before we serialize the model.</p>

            <p>Given that XGBoost outperformed other models, the next step is to serialize the XGBoost model using
                joblib. Once serialized, we can turn it into an API that allows you to input property details, such as
                those from Zillow, and predict property prices seamlessly. This approach ensures that the model is both
                portable and easily deployable for real-world use. </p>
