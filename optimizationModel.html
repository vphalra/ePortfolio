        <h4>Project Overview</h4>
        <p>
            In this project, we are developing an optimization model to optimize the company structure under the
            objective function of maximizing the net present value (NPV) of profits over the next eight quarters. The
            model considers key decision variables such as market penetration, commission rates, employee headcount, and
            office space requirements. By balancing these factors against constraints like operating budgets and market
            conditions, the model helps identify the optimal business structure for maximizing profitability.

    <!-- Objective Function -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h4>Objective Function</h4>
        <p>
            The primary objective is to maximize the NPV of profits over eight quarters. Quarterly sales forecasts are
            based on historical transaction data, while quarterly cash flows are derived from revenue (commission on
            sales)
            and operating costs (rent, utilities, and employee salaries). The formula for NPV is:
        </p>
        <p><strong>NPV = Î£ (Quarterly Profit / (1 + 0.015)<sup>t</sup>)</strong></p>
        <p>
            Where the discount rate is 1.5% per quarter, based on a 6% annual internal rate of return (IRR).
        </p>

    <!-- Constraints -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h4>Constraints</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Budget Constraint:</strong> The total monthly operating budget is capped at $15,000.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Penetration:</strong> The baseline market penetration is 5.5%, with adjustments based
                on the commission rate. Market penetration can vary between 4% and 5% depending on commission changes.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Office Rent:</strong> The office must occupy at least 250 square feet, plus 125 square feet
                per employee. Rent is calculated as 1.5% of the average price per square foot, paid monthly.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Employee Cost:</strong> Up to three employees can be hired, with each employee costing $65,000
                annually.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Revenue is determined by market penetration, commission rate, and quarterly
                sales forecasts.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Decision Variables -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h4>Decision Variables</h4>
        <p>
            The optimization model evaluates the following decision variables to determine the best configuration for
            maximizing NPV:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Number of Employees:</strong> Between 0 and 3 employees.</li>
            <li><strong>Office Size:</strong> Base size of 250 square feet, with an additional 125 square feet per
                employee.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Commission Rate:</strong> Adjustable between 4% and 5%, affecting both revenue and market
                penetration.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <!-- End Decision Variables -->

    <!-- Findings and Insights -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h4>Findings and Insights</h4>
        <p>The model produced the following optimal configuration:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Max NPV:</strong> $1,783,025</li>
            <li><strong>Number of Extra Employees:</strong> 0</li>
            <li><strong>Optimal Commission Rate:</strong> 5%</li>
            <li><strong>Optimal Office Size:</strong> 250 square feet</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By adhering to the model's recommendations, the company can maximize profitability while remaining within
            operational constraints. This approach ensures efficient allocation of resources and data-driven
            decision-making.
